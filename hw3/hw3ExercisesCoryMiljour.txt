3.1.13:  Binary Search.  Due to more get operations, the Log(n) performance of this algorithm guarantees minimal searching (get()).  Increasing exponential number of operations has little effect on search speed.

3.1.14:  Due to the larger # of insert operations, a sequential search in an unordered linked list is the best choice.  The insert time is N vs binary search 2n in the worst case.
